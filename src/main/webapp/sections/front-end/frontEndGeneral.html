		<h1>General Front-End Guidelines</h1>
        <p>In general, we follow the <a href="http://na.isobar.com/standards/">guidelines</a> set out by Isobar, who originally produced these pages .</p>
        <p>However, there are (and will be further) alterations that are specified by Virgin Holidays within this document, so you're best bet is to always look here.</p>

	<h2>Pillars of Front-end Development</h2>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Separation of presentation, content, and behavior.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/semantic_markup.shtml">Markup should be well-formed, semantically correct</a> and <a href="#validation">generally valid</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="http://icant.co.uk/articles/pragmatic-progressive-enhancement/">Javascript should progressively enhance the experience</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h2>General Practices</h2>
	
	<h3>Indentation</h3>
	
	<p>For all code languages, we require indentation to be done via soft tabs (using the space character). Hitting <em>Tab</em> in your text editor shall be equivalent to <b>four spaces</b>.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Readability vs Compression</h3>
	
	<p>We prefer readability over file-size savings when it comes to maintaining existing files. Plenty of whitespace is encouraged, along with ASCII art, where appropriate. There is no need for any developer to purposefully compress HTML or CSS, nor obfuscate JavaScript.</p>
	
	<p>We will use server-side or build processes to automatically minify and gzip all static client-side files, such as CSS and JavaScript.</p>
