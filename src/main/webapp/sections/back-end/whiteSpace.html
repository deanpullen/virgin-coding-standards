		<h1>White Space</h1>
		
		<p>This section includes info on where white space should appear in a Java source file.</p>
        <p>Different uses of whitespace is one of the main contributors of non-standard formatting, examine this
            section closely.</p>

	<h3 id="blankLines">Blank Lines</h3>
	
	<p>Blank lines improve readability by setting off sections of code that are logically related.</p>

    <p>Two blank lines should always be used in the following circumstances:</p>

    <ui>
        <li>Between sections of a source file</li>
        <li>Between class and interface definitions</li>
    </ui>

    <p>One blank line should always be used in the following circumstances:</p>

    <ui>
        <li>Between methods</li>
        <li>Between the local variables in a method and its first statement</li>
        <li>Before a block or single-line comment</li>
        <li>Between logical sections inside a method to improve readability</li>
    </ui>


	<h3 id="blankSpaces">Blank Spaces</h3>
	
	<p>Blank spaces should be used in the following circumstances:</p>

    <ui>
        <li>A keyword followed by a parenthesis should be separated by a space. Example:
            <p></p>
            <textarea class="brush:html">
                while (true) {
                    ...
                }
            </textarea>
            Note that a blank space should not be used between a method name and its opening parenthesis.
            This helps to distinguish keywords from method calls.
            <p></p>
        </li>

        <li>A blank space should appear after commas in argument lists.
            <p></p>
        </li>

        <li>All binary operators except . should be separated from their operands by spaces. Blank spaces should never
            separate unary operators such as unary minus, increment ("++"), and decrement ("--") from their operands. Example:
            <p></p>
            <textarea class="brush:html">
                a += c + d;
                a = (a + b) / (c * d);

                while (d++ = s++) {
                    n++;
                }
                printSize("size is " + foo + "\n");
            </textarea>
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            The expressions in a for statement should be separated by blank spaces. Example:
            <p></p>
            <textarea class="brush:html">
                for (expr1; expr2; expr3)
            </textarea>
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Casts should be followed by a blank space. Examples:
            <p></p>
            <textarea class="brush:html">
                myMethod((byte) aNum, (Object) x);
                myMethod((int) (cp + 5), ((int) (i + 3)) + 1);
            </textarea>
            <p></p>
        </li>
    </ui>
