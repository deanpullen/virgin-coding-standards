		<h1>Declarations</h1>
		
		<p>Declarations standards are generally adhered to, but here's a list of the most important rules.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="numberPerLine">Number Per Line</h3>
	
	<p>One declaration per line is recommended since it encourages commenting. In other words:</p>

    <figure class="preCode">Separate lines:</figure>
    <textarea class="brush:html">
        int level; // indentation level
        int size;  // size of table
    </textarea>


    <figure class="preCode">Preferred over:</figure>
    <textarea class="brush:html">
        int level, size;
    </textarea>

    <h3 id="initialization">Initialization</h3>

    <p>Try to initialize local variables where they're declared. The only reason not to initialize a variable where
        it's declared is if the initial value depends on some computation occurring first.</p>

    <h3 id="placement">Placement</h3>

    <p>Put declarations only at the beginning of blocks. (A block is any code surrounded by curly braces "{" and "}".)
        Don't wait to declare variables until their first use; it can confuse the unwary programmer and hamper code
        portability within the scope.</p>

    <figure class="preCode">Block:</figure>
    <textarea class="brush:html">
        void myMethod() {
            int int1 = 0;         // beginning of method block

            if (condition) {
                int int2 = 0;     // beginning of "if" block
                ...
             }
        }
    </textarea>

    <p>Avoid local declarations that hide declarations at higher levels. For example, do not declare the same variable name in an inner block:</p>

    <figure class="preCode">Block:</figure>
    <textarea class="brush:html">
        int count;
        ...
        myMethod() {
            if (condition) {
                int count = 0;     // AVOID!
                ...
            }
        ...
        }
    </textarea>

    <h3 id="classAndInterfaceDeclarations">Class and Interface Declarations</h3>

    <p>When coding Java classes and interfaces, the following formatting rules should be followed:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>No space between a method name and the parenthesis "(" starting its parameter list</li>
        <li>Open brace "{" appears at the end of the same line as the declaration statement</li>
        <li>Closing brace "}" starts a line by itself indented to match its corresponding opening statement, except when it
        is a null statement the "}" should appear immediately after the "{"</li>
        <li>Methods are separated by a blank line</li>
    </ul>


    <figure class="preCode">Formatting:</figure>
    <textarea class="brush:html">
        class Sample extends Object {
            int ivar1;
            int ivar2;

            Sample(int i, int j) {
                ivar1 = i;
                ivar2 = j;
            }

            int emptyMethod() {}

            ...
        }
    </textarea>
